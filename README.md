# Twotter

---

Twotter is a social media based app where users can send twotts and updates about anything. Users can look at other
users and their twotts without signing up, but if they want to post a twott themselves, they would have to sign up.
Upon signing in, a user can create a twott by clicking on the new twott button and then providing a title and description
for the twott.
Features such as retwotting and adding likes will be planned for the future.
